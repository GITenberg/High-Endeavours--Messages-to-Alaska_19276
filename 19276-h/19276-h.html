the maidservants of the Merciful has hastened to those parts, serving
as a librarian in the Public Library, and according to her ability is
not failing in teaching the Cause, yet the call of the Kingdom of God
is not yet raised through that spacious territory.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His Holiness Christ says: Travel ye to the East and to
the West of the world and summon the people to the Kingdom of God.
Hence the mercy of God must encompass all humanity. Therefore do ye
not think it permissible to leave that region deprived of the breezes
of the Morn of Guidance. Consequently, strive as far as ye are able
to send to those parts fluent speakers, who are detached from aught
else save God, attracted with the fragrances of God, and sanctified
and purified from all desires and temptations. Their sustenance and
food must consist of the teachings of God. First they must themselves
live in accordance with those principles, then guide the people.
Perchance, God willing, the lights of the most great guidance may
illumine that country and the breezes of the rose garden of the love
of God may perfume the nostrils of the inhabitants of Alaska. Should
ye become confirmed in thus rendering such a service, rest ye assured
that ye shall crown your heads with the diadem of everlasting
sovereignty and at the threshold of oneness you will become the
favored and accepted servants.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian has received your most welcome and

for pioneer teaching in Alaska.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>
He can well imagine the feelings of immeasurable satisfaction and
unbounded gratitude with which both the N.S.A. and the National
Teaching Committee must have welcomed your determination to teach and
establish the Faith in that far-off and hitherto unexplored
territory, and he wishes me to express also his own appreciation and
gratitude for this remarkable step which you have, notwithstanding
the well-nigh insuperable obstacles in your way, been inspired to
take to carry the Message to that distant land. The spirit of heroic
self-sacrifice, and of unflinching resolve that has prompted you to
undertake so noble and sacred a mission, and make such a warm and
immediate response to his recent teaching call addressed to the
American believers cannot but fill all hearts with admiration and
praise, and evoke the memory of those acts of unrivalled heroism, of
selfless and unstinted devotion that have characterized the lives of
the immortal heroes of the Apostolic age of our beloved Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though labouring in an age and under circumstances
wholly different from those in which those early pioneers of the
Cause have been privileged to labour, yet it is that selfsame spirit
of entire self-forgetfulness, of whole-hearted and unwavering
loyalty, and of absolute consecration that is now, in this Formative
period, inspiring you, and all our dear American Bahá’í
pioneers, to forsake their all and undergo such privations and
suffering in order to speed up and ensure the triumph of the Cause of
God.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rest assured that the Guardian will incessantly and most
fervently supplicate on your behalf, that the invisible hosts of the
Kingdom may continually reinforce and guide your efforts, and enable
you to attain this assuredly high and noble goal you have set
yourself to attain in service to Bahá’u’lláh
and His Cause.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the hope that this letter will find you well, happy
and well on the way of the realization of your plans, and with most

the general social and religious conditions prevailing in that land
clearly reveals the nature and extent of the obstacles which you have
to face and surmount in the prosecution of your teaching task. But
surely for such valiant and steadfast pioneers like you there is no
difficulty, however seemingly insurmountable, which cannot be
effectively overcome, as Bahá’u’lláh is
assuredly guiding and reinforcing your labours through the unseen
hosts of His Kingdom.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian was particularly encouraged to know of the
contact you have established with the editor of the “Alaskan,”
and of his very generous offer to publish in his paper various
materials on the Teachings. His hope is that this will prove a most
effective medium for the spread of the Cause, and will bring in a
large number of earnest inquirers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Also the Guardian cherishes very bright hopes regarding
the bookshop which you have opened in Anchorage, which he trusts will
serve to attract widespread attention to the Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He would not advise you to teach them Esperanto, as we
have no way of knowing whether it will ultimately be chosen as the
auxiliary language of the world. He thinks the most direct and
quickest way of communicating with them in a common tongue should be
chosen; in other words either you should learn their language or they
yours, whichever will yield the quickest results.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As they are a relatively uncivilized people, unused to
the modern cosmopolitan forms of life, and consequently not au
courant with the thoughts which to us have become mere commonplace,
he would advise you to approach them through love, friendliness, and
association, until you are in a position to enter into their
confidence, and gradually teach them, in a simple way, the great
truths of our Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To confirm them in the Faith should be your main
objective, always bearing in mind that faith and belief are different
from learning and a full grasp of the implications of such a vast

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear Bahá’í Friends:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your letter of Aug. 6th brought great joy to the
Guardian’s heart. It has taken it some time to reach him but he
has instructed me to answer it at once.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was particularly pleased to hear of the weekly radio
broadcasts you are giving, and feels that this cannot but have a
marked effect on the progress of the Cause in Alaska, both visibly
and spiritually.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although there are many souls ripe to receive the
message, there are many others who, though they are not able to
recognize its import at present, will take the seed into their
hearts, and there it will ultimately germinate. Radio reaches so many
people and thus is of the utmost importance.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was very kind of you to think of sending gifts to the
Guardian made by Eskimos, and he will value them as tokens of your
love and the handiwork of a people whom he is most anxious should
receive the Divine Message.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He hopes that your Assembly will endeavour to reach the
Eskimos with the Message; he fully realizes how difficult a task this
is, but it is also one of great importance. If but one of these souls
should become truly enkindled, he or she could then teach others in
their own language and a manner suited to their minds.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Assuring you all of the loving appreciation of your
devoted services, and his ardent prayers for the success of your
labours.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian feels that the four forthcoming Conferences

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Conferences will bring together representatives of
the entire Bahá’í World, representing twelve
national communities, made up of numerous racial and religious

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The purpose of the Conferences will be the world-wide
propagation of the Faith. They will lay the foundations of the
service of the Bahá’ís of the world for the great
ten year Crusade ahead—which, God willing, will be consummated
in the fulfillment of the prophecies of Daniel, and the achievement
of the initial goals set by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the
Tablets of the Divine Plan, whereby the world will be flooded with
the Glory of the Lord.</p>

for great sacrifice and service. The Guardian feels the Bahá’ís
of Alaska fully realize the heavy responsibilities devolving upon
them and will arise with a superhuman effort to spread the Faith
throughout the length and breadth of the country. He will welcome
advice of the opening up of new cities and centers throughout Alaska,
which will lay the foundation stones on which the future National
Assembly can be built. The only way this can be done is for the
Friends to “scatter” as the Master foretold, and settle
in new cities, areas, etc.</p>

new Centres throughout any territory, including, of course, Alaska,
he wishes you to give special attention to sending a pioneer to Point
Barrow, beyond the Arctic Circle. He feels that there is a great
significance in having believers serving so far north; and he hopes
that one of the friends will be able to secure some employment there
and proceed to act as a pioneer in this highly meritorious field.</p>

the incorporation of this Assembly an historical event. He likewise
appreciates the map which you sent showing the area involved in the

has so encouraged the Guardian that he has announced the formation of
the National Spiritual Assembly for Alaska in 1957. It is evident
that intensive teaching work must be done between now and that date,
so that there will be a sufficient number of Assemblies and a wide
enough basis of the Faith throughout Alaska to build up a proper
foundation for this crowning institution.</p>

in a region that must needs play a prominent part in the shaping of

Assemblies; of inaugurating a National Bahá’í
Fund; of establishing a Summer School; of initiating local Bahá’í
endowments; of incorporating the newly-emerged National Spiritual
Assembly as well as all firmly grounded local spiritual assemblies;
of obtaining recognition for the Bahá’í Marriage
Certificate, as well as the Holy Days on which work is forbidden; of
stimulating the conversion of both the Eskimos and American Indians,
and of purchasing a plot of land to serve as the site for the future

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your loving letter of May 15th was received by the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The contribution made by the friends in Ketchikan to the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The establishment of the new National Spiritual Assembly
in Alaska must be a source of great gratification to those of you who
have labored so long and diligently in the establishment of the Faith
in that very important country. This great blessing likewise carries
with it many serious responsibilities. The greatest responsibility
today is the diffusion of the Divine Fragrances and the establishment
of the Faith far and wide. The Guardian hopes therefore that the
Members of your Assembly will arise with renewed vigor and not only
spread the Faith more firmly in Ketchikan, but will spread your
energies to surrounding areas so that new lights of Divine Guidance
may be established in the various centers.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’ís
of Alaska</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear Bahá’í Sister:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The beloved Guardian has instructed me to answer the
letters received, with enclosure, from the Assembly’s Recording
Secretary and from the Secretary, and dated as follows: May 4, 7, 29
and June 11.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He is very happy to see the eagerness with which this
new historic Body has embarked upon its tasks, and he wishes you to
know that he is particularly pleased with the Alaska Community. He
admires the lively spirit animating it and which indeed has animated
it for years—the spirit of optimism and joyous service, and its
determination and courage. He has recently heard many fine things
about the friends there and the work they are doing from Mrs.
Florence Mayberry, all of which have encouraged him to cherish the
very highest hopes for the future of the work in that vast territory.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He hopes your Assembly will devote special, constant
attention to encouraging the friends in their teaching work, and
facilitate their tasks. As the new National Assemblies are being
formed, he feels it incumbent upon him to issue a word of warning to
avoid rules and regulations and tying the believers’ work up in
red tape. Over-administration can be even worse for the Faith at this
time than under-administration. The believers are, for the most part,
young in the Cause, and if they make mistakes it is not half as
important as if their spirit is crushed by being told all the time—do
this and don’t do that! The new National Body should be like a
loving parent, watching over and helping its children, and not like a
stern judge, waiting for an opportunity to display his judicial
powers. The reason he points this out to you is that constantly, for
the past twenty years and more, he has been pointing this out to the
old and tried National Assemblies, and he does not want the younger
bodies to make the same mistakes. Individual cases should be dealt
with as they arise, according to the Teachings, of which the
believers have quite sufficient available to handle all of their
problems at this time, and no more additional rules and regulations
need be introduced.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The friends should be helped to overcome their problems,
deepen in the Faith, and increase their unity and their love for each
other. In this way you will find that your work goes ahead speedily,
and that the National Body is like the beating of a healthy heart in
the midst of the Community, pumping spiritual love, energy and
encouragement out to all the members.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards the question you asked about a Summer School,
there is no reason why a property should either be rented or bought
for this purpose. You can arrange to hold a Summer School in any
suitable place where the friends can find accommodation, and a hall
can be rented for its sessions. This is what they have done in
England for many years to great advantage. It is a simple and
economical way of holding the School. The primary purpose of the
School is to deepen the knowledge of the friends in the Teachings, to
enable them to consort, as Bahá’ís, with each
other, and to confirm any contacts who may have attended. The School
may be held during the winter season or any other time of the year.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As regards local endowments, these can be a piece of
land, or a building offered or purchased in any place in Alaska.
However, as the friends have six years in which to accomplish their
Plan, and the most important work of all is the teaching work, he
would not advise that they begin by spending their money on these
projects, unless somebody has a piece of land or a building which
they wish to give. The site for the Temple is much more important. It
should be near the capital of Alaska within easy distance, or
preferably in it, so that the friends can gather there, when the
Temple is built for their services. If the twenty-acre National
Endowment is suitably close to the city, it can be used as the Temple
site, and another piece of land, smaller in area, and anywhere in
Alaska, be acquired as the National Endowment.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He is delighted to see that you are approaching your
tasks with so much enthusiasm, and awaits news of wonderful victories
from that promising northern territory.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He feels your Assembly should bear in mind, and call to
the attention of the friends, the importance of the Iron Curtain
territories not yet open. Whoever feels the urge to dedicate
themselves to arising and going to one of the satellites or republics
of the Soviet Union, should be encouraged to do so.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He hopes to receive much good news during the coming
months of the progress of the work there, and assures you all of his
prayers for your success.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With loving greetings,<br />R. Rabbani</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">[From the Guardian:]</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear and valued co-workers:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The formation of the National Spiritual Assembly of the
Bahá’ís of Alaska signalizes the erection of yet
another pillar designed to support, and reinforce the foundation of
the future Universal House of Justice, and marks a milestone of far
reaching significance in the history of the evolution of the Faith of
Bahá’u’lláh in the North American
continent. I rejoice at this remarkable evidence of the vitality of
the Faith which animates the members of the small yet highly
promising community of His followers in that far off northern region
of the globe, a region destined to play an important role in shaping
the spiritual destinies of the great Republic of the west of which it
forms a part, and to contribute, in no small measure, to the
establishment of the institutions of His World Order throughout the
American continent.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The task now facing this highly promising, spiritually
dynamic community, at the hour of its emergence as an independent
member of the embryonic World Bahá’í
Commonwealth, is truly formidable; the responsibilities which it
valiantly shoulders, at this crucial hour in its evolution are
sacred, heavy, manifold and inescapable. The tests and trials which
it must, sooner or later, experience in the course of its unfoldment
and consolidation will severely challenge its spirit and resources.
The path which it must tread ere the full evidence of its latent
capacities are manifested will be long, tortuous and stony. The
indomitable faith which now so powerfully animates its members,
however, will, beyond the shadow of a doubt, enable them to overcome
whatever obstacles may confront them in the future, and ensure the
ultimate attainment of their high destiny.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Six Year Plan, to which this community is now
committed, and which should be regarded as the chief and immediate
instrument designed to ensure the triumphant conclusion of the
initial stage in the unfoldment of its destiny, must be energetically
prosecuted however great the sacrifices involved, and must receive
the concentrated, the continuous and prayerful consideration of its
national elected representatives. All must participate in furthering
its interests and in ensuring its ultimate and complete success.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every effort must be exerted to increase steadily the
number of avowed adherents of the Faith in that Territory, to
multiply its centres, to consolidate its local Assemblies, to
incorporate the firmly grounded amongst them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The establishment of Bahá’í
endowments and of a summer-school, and the incorporation of the
National Spiritual Assembly itself, must be simultaneously and
efficiently carried out. Steps must likewise be taken to obtain
recognition of the Bahá’í Marriage Certificate
and of the Bahá’í Holy Days from the civil
authorities concerned. Nor must the vital obligation of converting as
speedily as possible, both the Eskimos and the American Indians, who,
as time passes, must assume a notable share in the diffusion of the
Faith and the establishment of its rising Order in these regions, be,
under any circumstances neglected; and last but not least, the
selection and purchase of a site for the Mother Temple of Alaska, in
the city of Anchorage or its suburbs, must be carefully considered
and suitable action taken at the earliest opportunity.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The endeavours which the highminded, youthful hearted,
deeply consecrated members of this community will exert must be such
as to excite the unqualified admiration of their fellow believers in
Bahá’í communities in both Hemispheres. The
sacrifices which must be made will, no doubt, if they rise to this
occasion, merit the applause of the Concourse on high and draw forth
a still fuller measure of the promised blessings of the Author of the
Divine Plan Himself.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the members of this community may neither falter
nor fail, that they may set an example worthy of emulation of their
fellow-workers in all continents of the globe, that they may achieve
such feats, in the course of the attainment of their high objectives,
as shall eclipse the past achievements of their spiritual brethren in
the North American continent and throughout Latin America, is the
object of my constant prayer for them in the Holy Shrines as well as
my heart’s most cherished desire.</p>

anything is printed in that language the Guardian would like to
receive copies for the libraries here.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He hopes through the “Arctic Trails Shopping
Service” you will be able to demonstrate the fairness,
uprightness, and nobility of the adherents of the Bahá’í

else attract their attention to the Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As to your own plans: if you are absolutely certain that
your departure from Alaska will not in any way affect the stability
of the Cause there, he approves of your suggestion that you go to
Europe and assist the work there. If, on your way, you could visit
and do some teaching in England it would help the British Bahá’ís
very much, as they are embarking on a very heavy teaching schedule.
He will pray that your family there may become attracted to the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(62) March 29, 1953</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear Bahá’í Sister:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your loving letter of February 14th has been received by
the beloved Guardian, and he has asked me to acknowledge it on his
behalf.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The contribution which you have made to the Shrine of
the Báb is very greatly appreciated. Receipt is enclosed
herewith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The work on the dome of the Shrine is going forward
quite satisfactorily. The brim of the dome has been finished. As
additional units of the building are completed, it adds to the
stateliness of the entire structure, and permits one to realize how
beautiful it is going to be.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian very deeply appreciates the wonderful work
you are doing in connection with the spread of the Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Eskimo booklet which you submitted for his approval
he feels should be submitted to the National Spiritual Assembly of
the Bahá’ís of the United States for their
review. The reason for this is that they are closely in touch with
the teaching work, and therefore well qualified to decide just what
should and what should not be included in such a pamphlet.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He hopes you and Frances Wells will work very closely
with the National Spiritual Assembly in connection with this
important service.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian is extremely anxious that the Eskimos be
brought into the Faith. He values very highly indeed the very
wonderful services rendered by Mrs. Wells. He feels that she has
sacrificed very deeply in order to carry the light of guidance to the
seeking peoples of the world, particularly in Alaska, and now with
the Eskimos. You may be sure the Guardian will pray for her spiritual
success and her spiritual happiness.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian will likewise be very happy to pray for
Mrs. Hadley Ferguson of Fairbanks, Mr. and Mrs. Walter Greene, Mr.
and Mrs. L.E. Pirkey, Mrs. Perry Bane, and Dr. Saul Mackoff.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian has communicated with the National
Spiritual Assembly with regard to the efforts being made by yourself
and Mrs. Wells as well as others in connection with the introduction
of the Faith amongst the Eskimos, asking them to render every
possible assistance to this most important work. It is impossible to
let you know how important the Guardian feels the introduction of the
Faith amongst the Eskimos is at this particular time.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With warm Bahá’í greetings,<br />Leroy
Ioas<br />Assistant Secretary</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">P.S.—The draft of your pamphlet is being sent
direct to the National Spiritual Assembly.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(63) December 7, 1953</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All Pioneers:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dearly Beloved Friends,</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The beloved Guardian sends you his loving greetings, and
he assures you of his prayers in your behalf.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">You will be most happy to know that at this time there
is only one country, Chagos Archipelago, which has not been assigned
to a settler, outside of the countries which are under Iron Curtain
influence. More pioneers are arriving at their posts daily, so that
at the present time, 71 of the new countries of the Crusade have been
opened to the Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">You are now the representative of the Faith in your
area, and the beloved Guardian feels assured that you will arise to
the great opportunity that has come to you, to become the one to
quicken the souls in your virgin territory and become the spiritual
conqueror of that new land. The Guardian realizes you will have many
problems and difficulties, but he urges you to persevere under all
circumstances; not to become disheartened in any way, but relying
solely upon Bahá’u’lláh and His quickening
Spirit, arise at once to carry forward the teaching work.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian makes the following suggestions with regard
to teaching in virgin areas, at this critical time:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">1. No publicity should be secured.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">2. No articles should be placed in newspapers or
magazines.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3. Do not contact Authorities or Political Leaders.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">4. Do not discuss Government policies in any way.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">5. No effort should be made toward a public proclamation
of the Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">6. Proceed with great caution.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">7. Be very wise in the manner in which the Teachings of
the Faith are presented.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">8. Make friends, and when these friends gain confidence
in you and you in them, gradually confirm them in the Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">9. What is needed is a complete reliance upon
Bahá’u’lláh; pure consecration to the
Faith, and then energetic but wise presentation of the Divine
teachings. Such selfless sacrificial devotion will attract the divine
confirmations, and gradually you will confirm souls who will join you
as strong supporters of the Faith in your area.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With warm Bahá’í
greetings,<br />Faithfully yours,<br />Leroy
Ioas<br />Secretary-General<br />International Bahá’í

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear Bahá’í Sister:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your letter of October 9th was duly received by the
beloved Guardian, and he has asked me to acknowledge it on his
behalf.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He very deeply appreciates the contribution which you
have made in behalf of the Eskimos of Alaska. Receipt therefor is
enclosed herewith. It is fitting that the Eskimos of Alaska be
associated with the work of the Shrine of the Báb, and your
having made this gift in their behalf is very appropriate, especially
as you are endeavoring to work with the Eskimos in that country.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian feels that you should write to the American
National Spiritual Assembly in detail concerning the problem of
Groups, Assemblies, etc. outside of Fairbanks. Certainly some basis
should be set up for the establishment of such Groups and Assemblies,
and he feels sure that within the principles that have already been
enunciated, the American National Spiritual Assembly can properly
handle the matter.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At his direction I am sending a copy of this letter to
the National Assembly, so that they will be informed of the matter
when you write to them.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian greatly values your sacrificial and devoted
services to the Faith. He is praying in your behalf. He likewise will
pray for the friends in Alaska, and also for those who are being
attracted to the Faith, particularly Mr. English, who is half Eskimo.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian was deeply appreciative of the spirit which
animated you in preparing the tape recording of the Ridván
Feast held in the home of an Eskimo family in Fairbanks.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With warm Bahá’í greetings, I am</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear Bahá’í Friends:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your loving communication of December 5th has been
received by the beloved Guardian, and he has asked me to acknowledge
it on his behalf.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The contribution which you have made to the Shrine of
the Báb is greatly appreciated. Receipt is enclosed herewith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The beloved Guardian is very happy because of the
response of the friends throughout the world to the Ten Year Crusade.
All of the virgin areas, with the exception of the Iron Curtain
countries, are settled or assigned to pioneers. There are now over
seventy of the virgin areas settled by pioneers, which bring the
number of countries within the pale of the Faith to over two hundred.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian is now deeply concerned with the
development of the Faith in the homelands. If the Faith is not
developed and spread in the homelands, it will ultimately affect the
success of the work in foreign lands. The Guardian therefore hopes
that the believers who have not been able to go to foreign areas
will, in accordance with the Master’s instructions, scatter to
the goal cities in the homelands, and thus aid in the establishment
of Spiritual Assemblies.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What is needed to achieve success in the teaching field
is a complete dedication on the part of the individual, consecration
to the glorious task of spreading the Faith, and the living of the
Bahá’í life, because that creates the magnet for
the Holy Spirit, and it is the Holy Spirit which quickens the new
soul. Thus, the individual should be as a reed, through which the
Holy Spirit may flow, to give new life to the seeking soul.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One should search out those who are receptive to the
Faith, and then concentrate on those persons in their teaching.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Bahá’ís in Alaska have a special
responsibility, and that is to spread the Faith rapidly in that vast
country. The success of the teaching work done by the Bahá’ís
of Alaska will determine how soon a National Spiritual Assembly will
be established in your country.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The beloved Guardian is praying for the success of your
efforts. He sends his loving greetings to you.</p>

your loving letter of December 28th, addressed to me, and has asked
me to assure you of his prayers in your behalf, for the success of
the noble mission you have undertaken. He will pray that the divine
confirmations may be with you always, so that many souls may find
eternal life, in that far off land, through your devoted and
sacrificial efforts.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He was pleased with the establishment of the fund for
the Hazírá for Alaska. It is his hope, the Friends will
arise with renewed effort in the Teaching Field, so many new centers
and Assembies may be estabished, thus enabling Alaska to achieve its
supreme goal of the NSA early in the Ten-Year Plan. Then the time
will be ripe for the building of the Hazírá, for which
the Friends are now contributing funds.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dear Bahá’í Friends:</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your loving letter of February 8th has been received by
the beloved Guardian, and he has asked me to acknowledge it on his
behalf. Your contribution to the international interests of the Faith
is greatly appreciated by him. Receipt is enclosed herewith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian is very happy with the development of the
teaching work in the virgin areas of the Ten-Year Crusade. Over 84 of
the countries have now been settled, bringing the number of countries
within the pale of the Faith to over 216.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian is hopeful that the friends at home will
arise with the same spirit of sacrifice and determination as the
pioneers abroad, and teach and spread the Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">More Bahá’ís, more Groups, more
Assemblies, are the immediate goals before the friends at home. He
feels sure the friends will arise as never before, and filled with
the Holy Spirit, quicken the seeking souls, leading many to the bourn
of immortality.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dedication to the heavenly task, complete consecration
to the noble mission, and living the life, are the requirements for
success in the teaching field.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The beloved Guardian greatly values the active services
of you two devoted workers in the Faith. As you know, the Guardian
feels that the future of Alaska is very important indeed,
particularly the city of Anchorage. One of the goals of the Ten Year
Crusade is the establishment of a National Assembly in Alaska. This
great bounty carries with it great responsibilities; and therefore
the Guardian is hopeful that each and every Bahá’í
in Alaska will redouble their efforts in order to spread the Faith
far and wide, and to bring many new souls into the Faith.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian feels sure that you two will render
distinguished and outstanding services in connection with the
development of the Cause in Alaska during the present Crusade. He
assures you of his prayers in your behalf, and sends you his loving
greetings.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your loving letter of March 16th has been received
through the courtesy of Mrs. Tuttle.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have prayed at the Shrines for the solution of your
problems; that all obstacles may be removed from your path, and that
your true field of Bahá’í service may become
clear and evident.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As a general principle, the Guardian has established the
order of importance in Bahá’í service as follows:
First, Pioneering in one of the virgin areas of the Ten Year Crusade.
Second, Pioneering in one of the consolidation areas of the Ten Year
Crusade. Third, Settlement and Teaching in one of the goal cities of
the home front campaign. This of course would include developing the
Faith in Communities where there is already a Group or isolated
Bahá’ís.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian feels that it is advisable for every
individual, after his own prayers and meditations and seeking of
guidance, to consult with the appropriate committee appointed by the
National Assembly. They are in touch with the ramifications of the
Campaign, and are qualified to give sound advice.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far as your personal affairs are concerned, the
Guardian assures you of his prayers in your behalf, that they may be
clarified for you. Of course the question of love and marriage is
something that can only be determined by the individual.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So far as the publication of the pamphlet in Eskimo is
concerned, it probably would be advisable for you to write the
National Assembly on this important matter, asking them what the
present status is, and if you can assist in any way.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He attaches the greatest importance to the spread of the
Faith in that territory, because, as you know, it is destined to have
a National Spiritual Assembly of its own ere the termination of the

and establish new Spiritual Assemblies, the sooner will the happy day

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your letter of December 15th has been received by the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He is happy to know that you are engaged in the service
of the Faith, and will pray that you may be strenghthened to perform
befittingly your part, and may be instrumental in guiding others to
this great Cause.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He urges you to teach all you can, both in Anchorage,
and, if possible, in surrounding towns. As you know, Alaska is to
establish its own National Spiritual Assembly during the World
Crusade; and the first step is the formation of a sufficient number
of Local Spiritual Assemblies.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In his visits to the Holy Shrines, he will remember all
the members of your family. He hopes your two dear children will
become pure and noble examples of the Bahá’í
life, and worthy instruments for the service of the Cause.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He will also remember in his supplications all the dear
friends in that land.</p>

he advises you to remain in Alaska, and try to find employment in
some place other than Anchorage, where you can assist in establishing
another Local Spiritual Assembly. There must be a sufficient number
of local Assemblies in Alaska in order to form a broad basis for the
National Body to be erected upon. He feels that this would be the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Alaska is a most important country, especially mentioned
by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in the Tablets of the Divine Plan.
The Friends there must arise with renewed effort to spread the Glad

assemblies, groups and Isolated centers, for the formation of the
National Assembly, and its vigorous functioning.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian was happy to learn that Alaska is awake to

on the basis of religion, but rather through the social teachings of
the Faith and its Laws, and make them understand the need for World

are so fanatically attached to their church.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Your letter of April 5th has been received by the
beloved Guardian, and he has instructed me to answer you on his
behalf.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He feels that now that you have found the thing you were
searching for inwardly, and have this added joy in your life of our
glorious Faith, you should be kinder to your husband and more
considerate than ever, and do everything in your power to make him
feel that this has not taken you away from him, but only made your
love for him and your desire to be a good wife to him, greater.
Whether he will ultimately be able to become a Bahá’í
or not, is something that only time can tell; but there is no doubt
where your duty lies, and that is to make him appreciate the fact
that your new affiliation has not interfered in any way with his home
life or his marriage, but on the contrary, has strengthened both.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is very difficult when one has found what one knows
is the truth, to sit by and see a dear and close relative completely
blind to it. The temptation is to try and “stir them up and
make them see the light”, but this is often disastrous.
Silence, love and forbearance will win greater victories in such
cases. However, your husband has no right to ask you to give up being
a Bahá’í. That is going too far. Nobody should
trespass on the sacred bond every human being has a right to have
with their Creator.</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Guardian assures you he will pray that you may be
guided to do the right thing at this difficult time, and that your
husband’s attitude may change.</p>
